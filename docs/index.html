  <h2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to MIST Automated Attendance System!!!</b></h2>
  <h3>
  	<b><u>ABSTRACT:</u></b>
  	The aim of the project is to ensure attendance automatically by using bio-metric (fingerprint) technology. Before entering into a class student will complete fool-proof bio-metric verification which will mark them present in the attendance sheet automatically. So this will save time wasted in calling out names. A web based platform is used on this project where a teacher and students can see the attendance record (percentage, fine, eligibility for exam etc.) from this platform based on accessibility. Proxy, skipping classes & late coming will be handled using sensors so it will keep track of the valid attendance records.
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<b><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></b>
  	Attendance record means a summary of the pupil's attendance during the period to which the information relates, showing the total number of possible attendances and the total number of unauthorized absences. Nowadays attendance is ensured by calling out the names which is more time consuming. Moreover sometimes it is tough for a teacher to prevent proxy and identify whether someone is entering late in the classroom or leaving the class before the finishing time. Automatic attendance system will ensure attendance each time a class starts and proxy is impossible as the attendance will count through biometric verification. Teacher is authorized to edit the attendance. So this platform will handle attendance related task automatically after ending of each class and total attendance record after each term for the teacher and as well as for students which will decrease attendance related complexity.
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	
  	<b><u>OBJECTIVE:</u></b>
  	Objectives to be achieved from MAAS:
	<li>To make an efficient biometric based automated attendance system</li>
	<li>To make it easy for both students and teachers to know about their attendance.</li>
	<li>To reduce late coming tendency.</li>
	<li>To reduce the trouble of manual application system for leave.</li>
	<li>To reduce wastage of time during manual roll calling system. </li>
	<br>
  	
  	<b><u>FEATURES:</u></b>
  	<li>Biometric based automated attendance for each class.</li>
  	<li>Storing data in a real time cloud based database.</li>
  	<li>Online application system.</li>
  	<li>Real time report generation.</li>
  	<li>Course wise fine and eligible student list generation.</li>
  	<li>Personal and class wise real time statistics generation. </li>
  	<li>Personal profile for each student, teacher and admin personals and access to data through their respective panels.</li>
  	<br>
  
	<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b>
	Mist Automated Attendance System (MAAS) is more precise and accurate with the attendance comparing with the previous manual system . is a generalized system for making the attendance taking process automated. MAAS provides flexibility to the stakeholderâ€™s preference. It also minimizes physical report and handling cases affiliated to the institution. The system is more transparent to all side of the users including: teacher, student and admin personals. As per implementation of the system we will be preferring MAAS should be easily applicable for any institution
	<br>
	<br>

	<b><u>FUTURE WORK:</u></b>

	The future extent of MAAS is to implement door locking system along with automated biometric attendance. The minor cases of failures and errors encountered in the system. These problems can be addressed by implementing door locking system. For implementing this extension with the existing system, proper feasibility analysis must need to be done so that the extended system become time efficient as well as secured
