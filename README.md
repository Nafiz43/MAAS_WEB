# MIST Automated Attendance System

## Introduction
### About the project

The aim of the project is to ensure attendance automatically by using bio-metric (fingerprint) technology. Before entering into a class student will complete fool-proof bio-metric verification which will mark them present in the attendance sheet automatically. So this will save time wasted in calling out names. A web based platform is used on this project where a teacher and students can see the attendance record (percentage, fine, eligibility for exam etc.) from this platform based on accessibility. Proxy, skipping classes & late coming will be handled using sensors so it will keep track of the valid attendance records.properly.

### Target user
The attendance system is designed for the students, teachers and the authority of military
institution of science and technology (MIST) for the proper attendance system. But with a
simple modification it can be used in any educational institution.

### Outline of the System

#### Software
We designed the web based system so that it can be accessed from any devices. It is
mainly used for showing the outcome of the system.

#### Hardware
Here sensors read all the parameter and pass these value to the database through Wi-Fi
module

## How to Use the System
### Hardware

• The fingerprint sensor is connected with the MCU module and attached outside the gate
so that one can scan his/her finger. It will confirm the match and push a notification.

• At the bottom of the door there will be LDR sensor at one side and a laser in another.
The laser ray has no side effect on us. If one cross the laser rays after the finger scanning
only then the attendance will be counted.
Apart from the discussed issues, the user has nothing to do more with the hardware part.
The other task of user is in software section (as described in next section (number)).

### Software
The software of the system is a web based system. The user can go to maas.mist.ac.bd to login.
For software use there is the manual to follow.

#### Login
By clicking on the login button present in the top right corner of the home page user can find the login page of the system.

A user ID and password is required to log onto the database server.
For the initial handover the system developer will assign admin. The admin can assign another admin. For MIST ICT division will be the initial admin. Admin will assign the Username and password for the users.
